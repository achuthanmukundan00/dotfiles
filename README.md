# Dotfiles

## My Setup
* Solus 4 Fortitude (I highly recommend this OS or Manjaro i3 - VERY COMPATIBLE!!)
* i3 Window Manager
  * i3-gaps
  * i3Status (I would use polybar, but I can't get it to compile on Solus)
* cool-retro-term 
* neovim
  * vim-plug
* powerlevel10k
* rofi (an alternative to dmenu for application launching)
* compton (compositor for X11, since i3 doesn't provide compositing meaning DISGUSTING screen tearing without this)
